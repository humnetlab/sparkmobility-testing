    Fills a U.S. county with H3 hexagons and estimates their population
    based on Census population data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_fips_code
        U.S. Census state FIPS code for the state containing the county
        to be tiled. See https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html
        for more info. This is a two-digit string. For California it is `'06'`.
    county_fips_code
        U.S. Census county FIPS code for the county to be tiled.
        See https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html
        for more info. This is a three-digit string. 
        For Alameda County, CA it is `'001'`.
    year
        The year to download data for. This is
        an integer year, for example, `2020`.
    hex_resolution
        The resolution of H3 hexagons with which to tile the county.
        This is an integer between 0 and 15.
    census_dataset
        The dataset to download from. For example `"acs/acs5"`,
        `"dec/pl"`, or `"timeseries/poverty/saipe/schdist"`.
    projection_crs
        The coordinate reference system (CRS) to project the data into when taking
        area measurements. This is a string, and `'EPSG:3310'` is used for California.
        **However**, The appropriate CRS for the area being examined should be used.
    census_variables
        The census variables to download, for example `["NAME", "B01001_001E"]`.
    census_geo_level
        The Census geography to query at the lowest level. This is a string like `'tract'`
        for Census tracts or `'bg'` for Census block groups. Make sure this geography
        is available for the specified dataset and year.
